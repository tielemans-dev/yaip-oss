- [Turbo](https://turbo.build/repo) — Repository task orchestration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Bun 1.3.9 (see `.bun-version`)
- PostgreSQL (or Docker)

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yaip.git
   cd yaip
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Copy the env file and fill in values:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Git worktrees also fall back to the main repository's `.env` if the worktree does not have its own copy.

   Generate a secure auth secret:

   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

4. If `DATABASE_URL` points to localhost, Docker will be used to auto-start Postgres when running `bun run dev`.
   You can still start it manually:

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name yaip-postgres \
     -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
     -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
     -e POSTGRES_DB=yaip \
     -p 5432:5432 \
     postgres:16-alpine
   ```

5. Start the dev server:

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

   `bun run dev` now runs a preflight that applies Prisma migrations automatically.
   In `yaip-oss`, this command is pinned to `selfhost` distribution mode.

6. If you want the full hosted simulation (cloud shell + cloud-configured OSS), run this from the workspace root:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/yaip
   bun run dev
   ```

   Then use:
   - `http://yaip.localhost:3000` for `yaip-cloud`
   - `http://app.yaip.localhost:3000` for cloud-configured `yaip-oss`
   - `http://localhost:3000` and `http://app.localhost:3000` will redirect to the canonical hosts above

7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Self-Hosting with Docker

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yaip.git
cd yaip

# Set your secrets
echo 'BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here' > .env

# Start
docker compose up -d
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## OSS and Cloud Split

- This repository is the OSS runtime baseline.
- This repository now also owns the versioned app artifact consumed by hosted cloud builds.
- Stable consumer entrypoints are exposed through the versioned `@yaip/oss` release artifact export surface.
- Hosted cloud-specific modules (managed billing/webhooks/infra) belong to a private `yaip-cloud` repository.
- Ownership and constraints are documented in `docs/architecture/oss-cloud-boundary.md`.
- Release and cutover checklist is documented in `docs/releases/oss-v1-cutover.md`.

## Testing

Run the standard test suite:

```bash
bun run test
```

Run the repo quality gates:

```bash
bun run lint
bun run typecheck
```

Run the full application TypeScript backlog check:

```bash
bun run typecheck:app
```

Run the DB-backed invoice/quote smoke flow (create/edit/send/convert) against your local PostgreSQL configured in `.env`:

```bash
bun run test:integration
```

Run the browser smoke suite against a local PostgreSQL and app server:

```bash
bun run test:e2e
```

## Bun-Only Repo

This repository is Bun-native. Use `bun install` and `bun run ...` commands for local development, CI reproduction, and self-host deployment workflows.

## Onboarding Behavior

- `selfhost` distribution keeps onboarding manual and local.
- `cloud` distribution hard-blocks invoice/quote creation until organization onboarding is complete.
- Completion requires invoice-readiness fields (company identity, locale/timezone/currency, tax regime, numbering defaults).
- Cloud-only onboarding AI endpoints are available under `onboardingAi.*` and only suggest/apply patches through the same canonical readiness checks.
